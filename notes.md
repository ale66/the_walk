AI can only hope to replicate: is discrimination well-developed in humans?

LLM grow on written text and AV, what about oral culture?

Society accepts fiction for fun, AI acceptance is for fun

no one noticed automated manual generation

EE 
AI as comunication partner vs. AI as fiction

we're oftern ok with AI as communication partner

hower, the difference could become blurred, so we need to be clear about when we want to talk to a human, strictly.
let's focus on fiction

JMK
novel as redistribution of the sensible

fiction was first about kings etc. Novel came about as common stories

example: Midjourney aesthetics become mainstream now

DS
AI is going back to the faboulous, realistic but not real

EE 
Fiction has its own rules

Marco
go beyond real vs. unreal
if something is perceived as real then it has real effects

PN
all voices are now equal status as they go into LLM, so it's more egualitarian

JMK
what is appealing to authors? To the general public?

EE
for LLM reality is data

AP: cyber-physical system do sensoring of the world

SR: humans are training LLMs now

RT: the novel prepares for alienation, for understanding a new social reality.
What kind of synthesis AI does now?

EE: thanks to fiction we all knew what was falling in love before 


DS
Please define synthetic

RT+JMK
AI is synthesising a model of the world
AI is neither human nor 'intelligent' but rather combinatorial, coherent in its own model

Hallucinations are not mistakes

SR
??

AP
The role of the author, but now it's a dialog
]

EE:
machines now are fed with synthetic data, they soon become useless
whereas actual user data is so much better

NT
Reality might not be the real starting point

AI is a bit 'in between' and people is quickly adapting, soon adherence to reality will be supplanted by aesthetic canons

Example: Grok, hundred of versions of the 'naked woman' theme.

Example: big waves flooding the city

it's fake but it resonates

DS

'realistic but not real' may be distracting.

Look at 'fiction allowing people to X' see whether AI is compatible with fiction. 
And when will it take off?

EE
Fiction is useful when it's about someone producing it

but now machines produce fiction, how we accept it?

MS
Let's focus on the role of the author.

JMK
did he see the novel as pacifying or a tool of resistance?

It put subjectivity in focus



EE
Prompting is authorship

DS
I read the NYT as a young person, but 90% was stock exchange data

Emma
now AI images are made to look realistic by pixellating the face of people, even though they are unreal


EE
at the beginning, real photo were deemed not good enough so staged photos were used instead.






Friday debate

EE: authorship? WHo's the author?
Homer, social authorship, the AI

Fake is more problematic than fiction

MS
realistic is more important than fake/real

focus on the recipients of the news: what is the effect?
Do metrics based on expectation, in order to understand 'effect'


SR
Orientiation to realism
but realism is a genre of fiction

Jour. also does synthesise and have voices
an op-ed, subjective journalism is more related to authorship
Also events need to be selected and filtered

'authorial journalism'



AP:
the artistic side of prompting
the scale that creates new qualities

Lack of metrics

SR:
AI can help synthesis

EE
Data selection is becoming a form of authorship as the author tries to meet an expectation
Society becomes an author

DS
What do you think about algorithmic fiction
fiction is a genre of writing
realism is a sub-genre of fiction, this is also the case in visual arts

Q: is realism applied to jour. in the same way as it is applied to fiction?

Is war of world the original fake news?
It's a deliberate deception

O. Wells didn't pretend that his work was realistic
A new concept is emerging with A. fiction

it will have some features of fiction, but not fiction itself.

MS: 'alternative facts'?

DS: A. fiction will promise a certain kind of representation


Narration pre-exist fiction

Before fiction the world was only what it is.

In fiction we have an alternative reality with its own rules
E.g., Sherlock Holmes cannot be a woman.

Historical fiction: describe historical facts with the freedom fiction gives the author.

The author connects the fiction to the reader, this is not possible for AI

AI itself is not arbitrary, not random as it reflects the realities described in the

Fiction is not a lie

Virtual is not fiction but also useful

NT
Back to AI text, mind that the categories are created by 'the world'.
But now AI is used in all genres, fiction is only one of them.
Why not test 10 cases to check the possible effects?

narrative

rewriting articles

funny fake videos

Emma
Realism depends on who's looking

NT
When does AI matters?
