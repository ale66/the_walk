### Context

Generative AI is transforming the media landscape. Tools capable of producing synthetic text, images, video, and audio are rapidly diffusing across newsrooms, social platforms, and search engines. While these outputs fuel innovation and creativity, they also trigger profound uncertainty — especially around how we distinguish between truth and fabrication, reporting and fiction, evidence and illusion. These technological advancements interrogate Computational Social Science. The sought-after outcome of this event is research advancements on automated assessment of text, image and AV sources. The working papers will be published in a white book and later in a special issue of an academic journal. 

We start from a historical parallel: when the novel emerged in the 18th century, it sparked intense societal anxiety. Fiction was viewed as a dangerous distortion of truth, capable of misleading the public. But over time, readers developed new interpretive skills. Fiction came to be understood not as deception, but as a valuable space for imagination, reflection, and cognitive training thus helping readers refine, rather than confuse, their sense of reality. 

Today, Generative AI may be provoking a similar epistemic crisis — not in literature, but in journalism. Synthetic content is increasingly realistic, but not real. These outputs are not simply fake — they are fictional, and demand new ways of seeing, interpreting, and responding.

### Theoretical Premise

Drawing on recent advancement across disciplines, this sprint takes seriously the idea that synthetic content is not only a truth problem, but also a fiction problem. We focus on a core property of fiction: fiction is realistic, but not real. It generates coherent, plausible worlds that refer to reality without being bound by it. In the age of Generative AI, this fictionality becomes a technical feature — one that is produced at scale, detached from intention, and embedded in social media. How do news producers, platforms, and audiences adapt to this shift? What kinds of discrimination is now needed to navigate a media environment saturated with synthetic content?

### Research Goals

The Data Sprint will investigate how Generative AI reshapes the boundaries between news and fiction, with a specific focus on journalism, AI-generated news articles, and viral (mis)information. Participants will work in interdisciplinary teams to map, trace, and analyze the emergence and circulation of AI-generated content that blurs the line between reporting and storytelling.

### Key Research Questions

- What forms of synthetic content are entering the media ecosystem, and how are they framed (e.g., satire, propaganda, clickbait)?
- What are the visual, rhetorical, and linguistic cues that help (or hinder) the identification of AI-generated content?
- How do we trace the life cycle of a piece of synthetic (mis)information, from generation to amplification to correction (or not)?

### Materials and Methods

A variety of methods will be used to investigate AI-generated content and its effects:

- **Synthetic image and content forensics**: Reverse image searches and metadata analysis of viral synthetic content (e.g., AI-generated war photos).
- **Text analysis**: Comparing AI-generated and human-written news articles on similar topics (e.g., prompting different LLMs starting from true piece of news)
- **Network tracing**: Mapping the spread of AI-generated news stories across networks (e.g., using tools like Hoaxy, Media Cloud or Hyphe).

### Why Fiction Studies? Why a Data Sprint?

Fiction is not just a literary category — it's a communicative mode. In the context of Generative AI, understanding fictionality is critical to grasp how misinformation operates beyond just falsehood. This Data Sprint brings computer scientists with semiotics and digital media scholars together to move past narrow definitions of true vs. false and toward a richer account of synthetic content. The Data Sprint format is ideal for this kind of inquiry: short, intensive, cross-disciplinary, and rooted in empirical experimental research informed by theory.
